┌─ debugging life one segfault at a time ─┐<br>
🔧 currently: venturing into C, C++, AI, CUDA, GPU things<br>
🧠 interests: systems, compilers, memory models, edge cases, and undefined behavior<br>
🚫 not a fan of: bloated abstractions (brotha eughw!)<br><br>


> “malloc() is my love language and segfaults are just spicy debugging sessions.” <br><br>

📬 reach out if you’re building interesting systems or breaking them.<br><br>

Since you're here now, do check out [systems-repository](https://github.com/segfaultscribe/systems-repository): A collection of small C projects that'll help you learn C and dive into systems level programming. It's still a baby repository but it's growing fast! Contributions are more than welcome. <br>Time to start seeing some `segmentation faults`, eh?
