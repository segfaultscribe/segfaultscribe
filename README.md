### **Highlighted Repos**<br/>
- [waford](https://github.com/segfaultscribe/waford): an asynchronous, highly concurrent fan-out delivery system that reliably forwards webhook events.
- [dripline](https://github.com/segfaultscribe/systems-repository): A usage enforcement focused reverse proxy built using Typescript in Bun and ElysiaJS.<br/>
