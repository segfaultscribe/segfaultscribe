┌─ debugging life one segfault at a time ─┐<br>
🔧 currently: venturing into C, C++, AI, CUDA, GPU things<br>
🧠 interests: systems, compilers, memory models, edge cases, and undefined behavior<br>
🚫 not a fan of: bloated abstractions (brotha eughw!)<br><br>


> “malloc() is my love language and segfaults are just spicy debugging sessions.” <br><br>

📬 reach out if you’re building interesting systems or breaking them.
